Hospital Admission Forecasting Based on Air Quality

This project predicts daily hospital admissions using air quality data through advanced time series forecasting techniques.

🔍 Overview

Built a deep learning model combining Transformer, Encoder–Decoder, and Time Series Analysis concepts.

The model learns temporal patterns between air pollutants (PM2.5, NO₂, O₃, etc.) and hospital admission counts.

Achieved an RMSE accuracy of 82.3%, indicating reliable forecasting performance.

Deployed a fully interactive Gradio web app for real-time predictions and visualization.
